# Matrix-Multiplication

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **Matrix-Multiplication** of class **computer architecture,** written in C with my team member [Ehsan Moslehi](https://github.com/eca852).

### Requirements
The main goal of this assignment was to optimize cache access for a well-studied, memory-bound application. To reach this goal we had to modify existing data structures and access patterns to exploit cache locality. We were given a ready-to-use program `matmul` which we had to optimize. First we had to modify the memory layout of the second matrix such that it is in column-major order. Second we had to implement a loop tiling algorithm in the function, that computes the multiplication. Of course, our output should be correct (our professor gave us a program, that checks our output for correctness).

It is hard to say what is exactly my part of the work because my team member and I worked most of the time together on one computer and corrected one another.
